# machine-learning used in TBM
combined with machine learning algorithms,it intend to predict the surrounding rock grade ahead of the tunnel boring machine's face and 
excavate the tunnel smartly;
first,it used SVR to establish a excavation-vibration parameters regression model for vibration prediction and optimization of tunneling 
parameters;
secondly,it established LSTM time series model of excavation parameters for advance prediction of excavation parameters;
thirdly,it uesd DNN to establish surrounding rock grade and excavation parameters classification models for real-time prediction;
finally,importing the real-time excavation data, this method will recommend the optimal excavation parameters at the next moment, and realize TBM intelligent decision-making.
